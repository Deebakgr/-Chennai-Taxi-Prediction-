# -Chennai-Taxi-Prediction-
This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting taxi fares in Chennai, India, using machine learning techniques. The app leverages a Random Forest model to estimate fares based on various inputs such as distance, duration, time of day, and traffic conditions. 

Features
Pincode-Based Predictions: Predict taxi fares from one pincode to another in Chennai by selecting the origin and destination pincodes.
Real-Time Traffic Adjustment: Fares are adjusted based on the current traffic conditions (Light, Moderate, Heavy) to reflect realistic fare expectations.
Time of Day Consideration: The fare prediction model takes into account the time of day using an AM/PM format to determine traffic patterns (e.g., higher traffic during morning and evening hours).
User-Friendly Interface: Users can manually input distance and duration (obtained from Google Maps) to get accurate fare predictions.
Performance Metrics: The app provides key performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) for the underlying machine learning model, giving insights into its accuracy and reliability.
